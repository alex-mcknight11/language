  <div id="cResult">
    <H2>You like C! The default! The white bread of programming languages. It's the one everyone knows. And maybe that's for a reason! And maybe the reason is that it's just sort of the default! Your favorite color is also <span id="colorResult" value="color"></span>. But that has nothing to do with your favorite programming language. Kinda silly that you think it would.</H2>
  </div>

  <div id="javascriptResult">
    <H2>You like JavaScript! The tried-and-true. It's weathered, worn, and weary, but it's never slowing down!
